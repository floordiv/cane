# Cane

PROJECT IS CURRENTLY FREEZED 

Cane is a simple scripting language. Contains front-end (full capability with Lotus), but currently implementing only interpreter (in progress).

Interpreter is useless in standalone production, cause it's too slow (imagine writing vm-less interpreter using interpreting python). But good as an integrable scripting language, like Lua (but in Python).

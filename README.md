# Cane
Cane is primary a front-end for Lotus, but also contains python-transpiler (unmaintained cause of it's useless), compiler (development will begin after I'll become a bit smarter), interpreter.

For language details, see [canonical Lotus interpreter implementation](github.con/floordiv/lily) (local interpreter will have a full-support of the previous implementation code)
